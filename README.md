## What is Memescreamer?

Memescreamer is an **autonomous media engine** powering our proof-of-concept [Doomscroll.fm](https://doomscroll.fm).  
It ingests global news, processes it with LLMs, generates commentary, music, and video, and broadcasts continuously with minimal human oversight.

- **LLM commentary** ‚Üí satirical, adversarial, culture-jamming voice  
- **Music generation** ‚Üí ACE-tag driven scores  
- **Video pipeline** ‚Üí automated with ComfyUI flows  
- **Broadcast automation** ‚Üí bulk uploading, live streaming, scheduling  

This repository contains the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 licensed components used in the Memescreamer production pipeline.  
Hereafter referred to as **Open Memescreamer**.

## Memescreamer Economics

**Sustained output:** ~1,500 hours of finished content per month  
**Operator time:** ~30 minutes/day  
**Hardware:** 3 GPU rigs (~‚Ç¨12,000 capex, 3-year life)  

### Cost Comparison

**Memescreamer (self-run):**
- Hardware amortization: ~‚Ç¨333/month  
- Power + cooling + infra: ~‚Ç¨410/month  
- Misc domains/services: ~‚Ç¨50/month  
- **Total: ~‚Ç¨750/month**  
- **Unit cost: ~‚Ç¨0.50/hour of finished media**

**Commercial SaaS equivalent (stacking OpenAI, Anthropic, 11Labs, Runway, etc.):**
- AI-generated scripts: ~$13,000/month  
- TTS: ~$45,000/month  
- Royalty-free music: $10,000‚Äì20,000/month  
- Video rendering: ~$1.35M/month  
- Distribution: ~$500/month  
- **Total: ~$1.42M/month**  
- **Unit cost: ~$950/hour of finished media**

üëâ Memescreamer is roughly **1,900√ó cheaper per finished hour** than duct-taping SaaS services together.  

üëâ Replicating this output with SaaS would take a full team working 20+ hours/day. 

** Memescreamer does it in 30 minutes of operator time **
