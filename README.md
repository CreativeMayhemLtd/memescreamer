## What is Memescreamer?

Memescreamer is an **autonomous media engine** powering [Doomscroll.fm](https://doomscroll.fm).  
It ingests global news, processes it with LLMs, generates commentary, music, and video, and broadcasts continuously with no human in the loop.

- **LLM commentary** → satirical, adversarial, culture-jamming voice  
- **Music generation** → ACE-tag driven scores  
- **Video pipeline** → automated with ComfyUI flows  
- **Broadcast automation** → bulk uploading, live streaming, scheduling  

This repo currently contains the **SpiderCat YouTube Bulk Uploader** used in the production pipeline.
